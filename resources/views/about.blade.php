                        The King Ateke Tom Foundation was born out of the complex and challenging history of the Niger Delta, a region rich in natural resources but plagued by decades of neglect, environmental degradation, and socio-economic strife. The foundationâ€™s roots are deeply intertwined with the personal journey of its founder, King Ateke Michael Tom, who rose from the crucible of these struggles to become a prominent leader in the region.

                     HRH King Ateke Michael Tom hails from Okrika, a town in the Rivers State of Nigeria. He became prominent in the early 2000s due to his involvement in the struggle for control over the resources in the Niger Delta. He left behind his roles as a fisherman, poultry farmer, and sand digger to fight for justice.
                    </p>

                   <p>
                     King Ateke Tom initially gained notoriety as a leader of the Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV), a militia group formed to protect the interests of the Niger Delta communities amidst the turmoil caused by the oil industry and government neglect. The NDV, under his leadership, was instrumental in drawing national and international attention to the plight of the region. Their activities were focused on fighting for resource control, environmental protection, and greater development in the Niger Delta region.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                     During an interview, Ateke mooted the idea of peace if his boys could be granted amnesty, provided skilled training and afforded jobs for them to live normal life.
                     Under Ateke Tom's leadership, the NDV engaged in armed struggles, including attacking oil installations, taking hostages, and clashing with both government forces and rival militias. These activities were part of the broader Niger Delta insurgency, where militants sought to claim a greater share of oil revenues for the impoverished region.
                     He faced relentless attacks and government hostility, yet his resolve never wavered. His mission was clear: to secure amnesty for his men and provide them with the skills and jobs needed to build a new life.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Recognizing that true progress required peace and constructive engagement, King Ateke Tom embraced the Nigerian government's amnesty program in 2009 offered by President Umaru Yar'Adua. An unconditional pardon and cash payments to rebels who agree to lay down their arms. This pivotal decision marked the beginning of a transformation to one of peacebuilding and community development.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>
                     When President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua saw Ateke Tom in the state house admist the amnesty resolutions, A highly elated Yar'Adua described Atekes visit as his 49th Independence gift, saying that <strong>"this independent anniversary gift you have given me, I cherish very much because of all those things I cherished, one of them is peace and security in the Niger Delta, it has always pained me to see our brother and sister  Nigerians taking up arms against fellow Nigerians and are ready to live in the creeks under very difficult situations and conditions because of such issues that agitated their minds. But by the grace of God and the kind heart and the goodwill you have brought to this amnesty programme, this is coming to an end"</strong>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Our minds would draw back to the following interview of King Ateke.
                     <strong><i>What else would you want the government to do for you and your boys so that there could be peace, that is in, addition to the compensation for what was damaged during the attack on your base? Let the government find jobs for the boys and involve those who wish to learn any trade in skill acquisition, so that they can live their lives peacefully.
                     Are you saying that if the government comes and says bring the list of the names of your boys so that they could be employed, as a sort of amnesty, will that end the problem between you and government? Of course there will no more trouble; we would not feel concerned about anything anymore. Because we are not robbers, we are loyal citizens going about our lives quietly.</i></strong>

                    </p>
                    <p><strong><i>
                     If the problem between you and the government is settled, how would you want to live your life? Already I am a quiet man, I made peace and resolved to keep the peace, I have been living quietly, I have nothing against anyone. But our things must be returned or compensated for and we will remain quiet.</i></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The King Ateke Tom Foundation emerged from this transformation as a beacon of hope, dedicated to the sustainable development of the Niger Delta and beyond.</p>

                  <p>
                    This honor was officially sanctioned with the presentation of the staff of office by His Excellency, Barr. Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, the then-Governor of Rivers State, cementing King Ateke Tomâ€™s role as a leader committed to progress and peace for his people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a further testament to his enduring impact, more recently in March of this year, His Excellency Siminalaye Fubara, the current Governor of Rivers State, bestowed upon King Ateke Tom the certificate and staff of office as a First-Class King. This recognition, a significant milestone in the Kingâ€™s reign, acknowledges not only his leadership within Okochiri Kingdom but also his influence across the wider region.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    King Ateke Tomâ€™s journey from a fighter for his peopleâ€™s rights to a First-Class King is a testament to his sacrifices and the profound respect he commands. His legacy continues to inspire the mission of the King Ateke Tom Foundation, which remains dedicated to improving the lives of the less privileged and fostering sustainable development in the kingdom and beyond.
